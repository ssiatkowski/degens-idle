The memory of that battle lingers, a testament to your newfound strength.

                <p>You‚Äôve grown stronger than you ever imagined, but that power feels strangely hollow. The words Vegeta uttered before his fall echo in the quiet moments: ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs out there, threatening the multiverse.‚Äù But who is this mysterious "she"? What kind of terror could instill such fear in one as powerful as him?</p>
                <p>You can‚Äôt shake the feeling that your journey is far from over. The strength you‚Äôve gained was meant for something greater‚Äîsomething beyond the battles you‚Äôve fought. Perhaps the hopelessness you feel is the void left by an unfulfilled destiny, a path that still lies ahead.</p>
                <p>To regain your hope, you must seek her out, confront the force that even Vegeta feared. Only then will you uncover the true purpose of your power, and perhaps, find the redemption that seems so elusive. The multiverse hangs in the balance, and deep down, you know that the real challenge is yet to come.</p>`,

                        Saitama breathes heavily, sweat dripping from his brow, bruises marking his usually invulnerable body. His excitement is palpable, a faint smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ you actually pushed me. I didn‚Äôt think it was possible,‚Äù he says, his voice carrying an unfamiliar edge of exhilaration. For the first time in years, he felt the rush of a real fight. You can see it in his eyes‚Äîa spark that wasn‚Äôt there before. ‚ÄúYou gave me a real challenge... I haven‚Äôt felt this alive in so long.‚Äù
                    </p>

                        You stand there, staring at him, the weight of your victory sinking in. You've hurt him‚Äîtruly hurt him‚Äîbut something feels off. Instead of triumph, there‚Äôs an unsettling hollowness growing inside you. This was it, the fight you dreamed of, the one that was supposed to give you meaning. But now, in this moment of victory, as Saitama acknowledges your strength, it feels... empty.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 1.2em; color: #b3a125;">
                        ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù Saitama says, his grin widening, almost childlike. ‚ÄúThis is the fight I‚Äôve been waiting for. I didn‚Äôt think anyone could ever push me this far.‚Äù He coughs, clutching his side, clearly in pain, yet his eyes shine with a light you‚Äôve never seen before. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve done it. You‚Äôve made me care about fighting again.‚Äù

                        His words should fill you with pride, but instead, they leave you hollow. You won. You gave him what he wanted. But what about you? As Saitama revels in the moment, you can‚Äôt help but feel a sense of loss creeping in. You‚Äôve spent so long training, pushing yourself beyond limits, all for this moment‚Äîthis chance to prove yourself against the only being who could rival your strength. And now that it‚Äôs over, there‚Äôs nothing left. No higher peak to climb. No grander opponent to face. You've won, but at what cost?
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 1.2em; color: #b3a125;">
                        ‚ÄúSo, what now?‚Äù Saitama asks, his voice light but genuine. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve beaten me, or close enough. What‚Äôs next for you?‚Äù He looks at you curiously, like someone who still has something to look forward to. There‚Äôs a fire in his eyes now, one you‚Äôve reignited. But you? You‚Äôre left with only the smoldering ashes of what you once thought was your purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 1.2em; color: #6b8ca4;">
                        What now? The question hangs in the air, echoing through the battlefield and deep into your soul. You try to think of an answer, but there‚Äôs nothing. No more mountains to climb. No more enemies to face. Your journey, once driven by the desire to overcome, has left you standing at the edge of a void. The thrill of the fight, the struggle for purpose‚Äîit‚Äôs all gone now. You thought that defeating him would bring you fulfillment, but instead, it has left you adrift in an endless sea of uncertainty. 
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 1.2em; color: #6b8ca4;">
                        You glance at Saitama, now recharged with a sense of purpose you‚Äôve unknowingly given him, but that same purpose has slipped through your fingers. You have achieved the ultimate victory... and now you stand at the summit of existence, staring down into a vast emptiness where meaning once was. What do you do when you‚Äôve won the greatest battle of your life, only to realize that the fight was all you had? 
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 1.2em; color: #6b8ca4;">
                        Saitama walks away, still smiling, while you remain motionless. You have everything... and yet nothing. The fight is over, and with it, the purpose you had built your life around. What‚Äôs left? What can possibly come next?

        message: ` <p>After pushing past all physical limits, you‚Äôve discovered that the true answers lie beyond the material world. You have unlocked <strong>Meditation</strong>, a metaphysical realm where the deepest questions can be answered. In this state, you will be guided through an abstract challenge: keep a set of mystical <strong>balls</strong> within the boundaries of a meditative space for a certain duration. Succeeding in your meditation will reveal powerful upgrades, each related to different belief systems, philosophies, religions, and worldviews.</p>
                    <h3>How the Meditation Game Works:</h3>
                    <p>During meditation, your goal is to ensure that the mystical balls remain within a bounded arena. Your mastery of resources will determine how well you can maintain focus and balance. Here‚Äôs how each of your resources will help increase your chances of success:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Copium</strong> - Influences <strong>Ball Size</strong>. More Copium means smaller balls, making it easier to keep them in bounds.</li>
                        <li><strong>Delusion</strong> - Impacts <strong>Turn Radius</strong>. A greater delusion will cause the balls to adjust their direction more quickly, pulling them back toward the center faster.</li>
                        <li><strong>Yacht Money</strong> - <strong>Reduces Meditation Duration</strong>. The more you accumulate, the shorter the time needed to complete the meditation challenge.</li>
                        <li><strong>Troll Points</strong> - Increases <strong>Respawn Time</strong>. This gives you more time before a ball that goes out of bounds reappears, offering brief relief.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hopium</strong> - <strong>Reduces the Total Number of Balls</strong>. With more hopium, fewer balls need to be managed during meditation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Knowledge</strong> - Affects <strong>Velocity</strong>. Higher knowledge will slow down the speed of the balls, making it easier to keep them within bounds.</li>
                        <li><strong>Power</strong> - Affects <strong>Gravity</strong>. A stronger pull toward the center ensures that balls are less likely to stray too far from the boundary.</li>
                        <li><strong>Serenity</strong> - Provides additional <strong>Focus</strong>. More serenity allows more balls to go out of bounds before you lose focus and fail the meditation.</li>
